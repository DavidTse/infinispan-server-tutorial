== Client Server Tutorial

=== Run an Infinispan Server locally

For this tutorial, the first thing we need to do is to run an Infinispan Server.

==== Option 1: Use Docker (recommended way)

Use the Infinispan Server docker image to run a standalone infinispan server.

The server is secured by default with a simple security realm.
Provide a USER and PASS. In this tutorial we will be using 'user' and 'pass' credentials.

`docker run -it -p 11222:11222 -e USER="user" -e PASS="pass" infinispan/server:11.0`

==== Option 2: Download the server

- Go to the infinispan https://infinispan.org/download/#stable[downloads] and download the server

- From the installation directory create a user using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
`./bin/cli.sh user create`

- Run the server
`./bin/server.sh`

For this tutorial we will be using 'user' and 'pass' credentials, but feel free to chose your own.

==== Check the Server is correctly running

Open a navigator in `http://localhost:11222/'. The welcome page of the Infinispan Server
should be displayed.

Click on the 'Go to the console button, enter the credentials 'user' and 'pass' and
display the Console Web.

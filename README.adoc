== Client Server Tutorial
After completing this guide, you will know:

. How to run the Infinispan Server locally
. How to connect to the Infinispan Server web console
. How to create caches in the Infinispan Server
. How to put and read primitive data
. How expiration works
. How client listeners work
. How to put and read non primitive Java Objects
. How to query values

=== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

- 25 minutes
- an IDE
- JDK 8 or 11+ installed
- Apache Maven 3.6.2.+

TIP: Verify Maven is using the Java you expect
If you have multiple JDKâ€™s installed it is not certain Maven will pick up the expected
java and you could end up with unexpected results. You can verify which JDK Maven uses by
running mvn --version.

=== Run an Infinispan Server locally

For this tutorial, the first thing we need to do is to run an Infinispan Server.

==== Option 1: Use Docker (recommended way)

Use the Infinispan Server docker image to run a standalone infinispan server.

The server is secured by default with a simple security realm.
Provide a USER and PASS. In this tutorial we will be using 'user' and 'pass' credentials.

`docker run -it -p 11222:11222 -e USER="user" -e PASS="pass" infinispan/server:11.0`

==== Option 2: Download the server

- Go to the infinispan https://infinispan.org/download/#stable[downloads] and download the server

- From the installation directory create a user using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
`./bin/cli.sh user create`

- Run the server
`./bin/server.sh`

For this tutorial we will be using 'user' and 'pass' credentials, but feel free to chose your own.

==== Check the Server is correctly running

Open a navigator in `http://localhost:11222/'. The welcome page of the Infinispan Server
should be displayed.

Click on the 'Go to the console button, enter the credentials 'user' and 'pass' and
display the Console Web.

=== Architecture

In this tutorial we will build a Weather System. This system is composed by 4 java applications.

Clone the
If you want to build the tutorial from scratch, clone the 'init' branch in the repository.

=== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions from Boostrapping project and onwards to create the application step by step.

However, you can go right to the completed example.

Download an archive or clone the git repository:

git clone https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-server-tutorial.git
The solution is located in the 'solution' branch.

=== Bootstrapping the project

`git clone https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan-server-tutorial.git`

In the master branch you will have the minimum code and all the place holders to complete this tutorial.

=== Connecting to the Infinispan Server using the Java Client

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.infinispan</groupId>
    <artifactId>infinispan-client-hotrod</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.db.DataSourceConnector.java
[source,java]
----
ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();

builder.clientIntelligence(ClientIntelligence.BASIC);

builder.addServer()
       .host("127.0.0.1")
       .port(ConfigurationProperties.DEFAULT_HOTROD_PORT);

builder.security().authentication().username("admin").password("pass");
----

=== Creating the 'Temperatures' cache

.db.DataSourceConnector.java
[source,java]
----
public RemoteCache<String, Float> getTemperatureCache() {
   return remoteCacheManager.administration()
              .withFlags(CacheContainerAdmin.AdminFlag.VOLATILE)
              .getOrCreateCache("temperature", DefaultTemplate.DIST_SYNC);
}
